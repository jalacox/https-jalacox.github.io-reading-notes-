<h1> Expressions and operators </h1>

These Javascript expressions and operations inlcude many operators that join operands either formed by higher-precedence operators or one of the basic expressions. You will be introducted to operators like...

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- BigInt operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators

These operators join operands either formed by higher-precedence operators or one of the basic expressions. A complete and detailed list of operators and expressions is also available in the reference.

The precedence of operators determines the order they are applied when evaluating an expression. For example:

const x = 1 + 2 * 3;

const y = 2 * 3 + 1;

* <sub> Despite * and + coming in different orders, both expressions would result in 7 because * has precedence over +, so the *-joined expression will always be evaluated first. </sub>
