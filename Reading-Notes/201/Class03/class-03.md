# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

In these notes you will find and read up on material on more HTML, CSS and Javascript. I will be answering questions on ordered and unirdered lists, The Box Model, Arrays, Operators and Expressions, Conditionals and Loops... I know what a mouthfull, but your about to recieve and brain full! üß†üî•

[Ordered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) and [Unordered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul)

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

- Grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless

2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

- You add the style attribute within the ul start tag.

3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

- Unordered list are Used to create a list of related items, in no particular order. Ordered list are Used to create a list of related items, in a specific order.

4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

- Your ordered list can also start with the letter A and go through B, C. Can also use Roman numerals 'I'.

[**The Box Model**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)

Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: ‚ÄúThe Box Model‚Äù?

<h3> The Box Model :</h3>

 The margin property protects the house like a security system, and the padding property is the family inside the house. The End.

List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

**Content** - The content of the box, where text and images appear.

**Padding** - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.

**Border** - A border that goes around the padding and content.

**Margin** - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.

**Learn JS** ‚û§ [Click here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

[Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays), [Operators and Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators), [Conditionals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals),[ Loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code) 

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?

* They can store numbers, strings, boolean values (true and false), characters, objects, and more...

2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

* This is javascript array is valid because you access the value by accessing the 

3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

- **Division assignment**	x /= f() or  x = x / f() Divides the variable.

- **Remainder assignment**	x %= f() or	x = x % f() divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the remainder to the variable.

- **Exponentiation assignment**	x **= f() or	x = x ** f() operator raises the value of a variable to the power of the right operand.

- **Left shift assignment**	x <<= f() or	x = x << f() moves the specified amount of bits to the left and assigns the result to the variable.

- **Right shift assignment**	x >>= f() or	x = x >> f() moves the specified amount of bits to the right and assigns the result to the variable.

4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

- The result would be 

a = 10, b = ‚Äòdog‚Äô, and c = false
(a+c)+b = 10dog

5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

- Using a code machine for a car when a car is having car trouble, can read the codes to determine what needs to be fixed, it gives and error. 

6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.

- Using an ATM and the machine doing the transactions for customers whom use the machine.
