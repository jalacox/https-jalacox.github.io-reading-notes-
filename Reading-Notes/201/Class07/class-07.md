[Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

Explain why we need domain modeling.

- To carry out a common language and a fundamental structure important for the analysis of features and epics

[HTML Table Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics)

Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

- HTML tables were originally intended to be used for presenting tabular data, not for layout.

List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table.

- This defines a section in a web page. : This element contains the main part, containing information about the web page. : The content is often placed as a sidebar in a document. : It defines a footer for a document or a section.

[Introducing Constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)

What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

- Constructors are methods that are automatically executed every time you create an object. The purpose of a constructor is to construct an object and assign values to the object's members. A constructor takes the same name as the class to which it belongs, and does not return any values.

How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

- When a change is made to the object, it affects the object entire the script for an object literal. Whereas if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made to it, that change wonâ€™t affect the object throughout the script.
