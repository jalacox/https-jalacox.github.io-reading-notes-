How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

- Events are things that happen in the system you are programming.

When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

- Adding a function or object that implements EventListener.

Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

- It is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information. The target property of the event object is always a reference to the element the event occurred upon.

What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

- Event capturing is like event bubbling but the order is reversed: so instead of the event firing first on the innermost element targeted, and then on successively less nested elements, the event fires first on the least nested element, and then on successively more nested elements, until the target is reached.
