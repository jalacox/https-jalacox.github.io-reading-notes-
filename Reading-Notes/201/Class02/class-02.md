Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

* Semantics are relied on everywhere around us—we rely on previous experience to tell us what the function of an everyday object is; when we see something, we know what its function will be.

## ☆ Learn CSS ☆

What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

- With an external stylesheet, with an internal stylesheet, and with inline styles. external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a style element contained inside the HTML head.

Why should we avoid using inline styles?

- "First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website."
