<h1> Programming with JavaScript </h1>

<h3> Control flow </h3>

- The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:

<h1> JavaScript Functions </h1>

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

<h3> - JavaScript Function Syntax </h3>

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ( ).

<h3> - Function Invocation </h3>

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

1. When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
2. When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
3. Automatically (self invoked)

<h3> - Function Return </h3>

When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

Why Functions??? 

You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
