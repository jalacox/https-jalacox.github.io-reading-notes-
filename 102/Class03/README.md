5. Remote Repositories.

__Version Control__  is a system that shows various versions of a file/Files by making changes. 

__Centralized Version Control__
 This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. 

__Distributed Version Control__
A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. If it does not work then no one will be able to make or save changes within the system.To prevent this type of loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.

<h3>SOOOO... what is Git? ðŸ¤” </h3>  <sub> 

Glad u asked </sub> ðŸ¤“

<p> Git contain snapshots that store date in a file system and it is make up its snapshots. Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. Git also rely on Local Operations because thats where most information can be found. Tracking changes,your every move ðŸ‘€ is tracked by git and theu will always peep file destruction or loss of date in transit. Which brings me to the loss of data, "Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost."






- Committed

Data is securely stored in a local database. 

- Modified

File has been changed but not committed to the database.

- Staged

Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.
