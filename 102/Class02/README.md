 Itâ€™s important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code. You have different varities of **Free** third party softwares like...

- Notepad++
- Text Wrangler
- BB Edit
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Atom
- Brackets
- Sublime Text

 <p> All for download for Mac, Windows and Linux computers. Most support HTML, CSS and JavaScript, though more coding can be added through extensions that u put through your Terminal. Chooseing a good Text editor you should always look for one that you are comfortabke to work with and also some important features to look for would be.  

 1.) code completion

 2.) syntax highlighting

 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)

 4.) choosing vaild extensions available when you need them. </P>

<h3> The Command Line </h3>
- A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. So basically you are giving commands to your system and to break it down here is an example shown below in the link.

<h3> Basic Navigation </h3>

This is pretty much some of the basics of moving aroud the system, and being able to reference the correct files and locations in the system. Also the foundation of being able to code in Linux.

- pwd stands for Print Working Directory, it tells you Where are we currently working.

- ls is the List the contents of a directory.

- cd Changes Directories, or move to another directory.

Relative path - A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

Absolute path - A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.


<h3> About Files </h3>

**EVERYTHING** is a **FILE!**!!
 A text file is a file, a directory is a file, keyboard is a file, your monitor is a file as well along with many more. A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is. The following are common extensions:

>file.exe - an executable file, or program.

>file.txt - a plain text file.

>file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image. 

Limux is Case Sensitive and also putting spaces in names is very important. You wanna make sure there are proper spaces in the command line. Thats how we seperate items inside of our file.
